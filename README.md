# eMerchant project #


eMerchant is the Open-Source payment platform for PCI compliance environments. 

Some ecommerce environments don't allow to manipulate any kind of sensible data like credit cards numbers. Usually the payment flow in these platforms always go through third party sites where this sensible data is captured.

The aim of this project is to create a framework to manage this payment flow in the way that several payment providers can be managed with the same interface.
